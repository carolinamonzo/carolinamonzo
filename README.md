## Hi there, I'm Carolina 👋

I'm a Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions Postdoctoral Fellow with a background in bioinformatics and aging.  
I mostly work with python, but have developed both [python](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/35/4/987) and [R](https://academic.oup.com/bib/article/26/2/bbaf110/8089935?utm_source=advanceaccess&utm_campaign=bib&utm_medium=email) packages.  
My main interest is in using statistics to answer biological questions 🐁. But I'm also a big fan of biodiversity 🌊🌱.
